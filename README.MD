A simple vim configuration. Please check the branches:

windows

This [vimrc](./vimrc) is only for Windows. I'm using [msys2](https://www.msys2.org/). Listing some required package(s):

- <https://packages.msys2.org/package/mingw-w64-x86_64-clang-tools-extra> (for [lsp](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol) in cpp files [clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/) is powerful most of the time)

I do **NOT** split [vimrc](./vimrc) into many modules.

linux

I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/). After re-writing with [lua](https://www.lua.org/), I'll push it.
